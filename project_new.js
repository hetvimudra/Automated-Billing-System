      <div>Currently, I am a student at the Gujarat Technological University's <b>New LJ Institute Of Engineering & Technology</b>. <b>Information & Technology </b>are my fields of expertise. I'm pursuing for a bachelor's degree in engineering.My enrollment number is <b>201430116004</b>.This is the fourth semester for me. I'm a programmer with a smattering of hardware experience. <b>C, Python, HTML, CSS and Object Oriented Programming </b> among the languages I am proficient in.My CPI is<b> 9.46</b>. My primary goal in developing this model was to save consumers' time, provide quick and efficient shopping, and eliminate the need for cart weight, so improving shopping for people of all ages. We have also kept <b><u>senior citizens </u></b> mind in our shopping mall because everyone ignores them. However, our main goal is to build a system that is beneficial to everyone, and smart billing will help customers no longer need to carry cash.</div><br>
